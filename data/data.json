        "description": "The Sundarbans are one of the last truly wild places in the world, so dense and inhospitable to humans they have been largely left alone and now harbor the worldâ€™s largest continuous population of tigers. As well as this large population of tigers the forests and waterways are also home to thousands of deer, monkeys, and dozens of species of birds and are the last stronghold for the critically endangered Gangetic river dolphin. This tour is the only tour around that caters of wildlife watchers as we charter are own boat and cruise to the heart of the Sundarbans in search of tigers and the other wildlife of this incredible place.",
